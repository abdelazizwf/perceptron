# MLP
This repository is adapted from an assignment in a university Artificial Neural Networks class. The goal was to build a Multilayer Perceptron in python using NumPy and Pandas, with a GUI interface using Tkinter, and use it to classify data in the penguins dataset (`data/penguins.csv`) and optionally the MNIST dataset.
I decided to use that code to apply several new topics I learned in Git, GitHub, Python, AI, and Neural Networks, as well as writing better code and refactoring old code. All the new work starts from the `rebirth` tag.

## Usage
To use this code, clone the repository and use the `requirments.txt` to install the required libraries (using a virtual environment is recommended), and just run `main.py`.
